    loreText: "Excerpt from The Herald, November 14, 1998 \u2014 Page 6, Local News
      Briefs:\n\n\"Unexplained Incident at Private Card Room Raises Questions\"\n\nAuthorities
      remain tight-lipped following the abrupt shutdown of a private club operating
      behind the Velvet Room Bar on Holsten Street earlier this week. Sources close
      to the investigation have confirmed that the venue, known to select patrons
      as \u201CThe Deck,\u201D functioned as an unregistered high-stakes poker lounge.\n\nOne
      of the individuals linked to the club, a certain John R., has reportedly not
      been seen since the night of a major game held last Friday. While no official
      connection has been made, unverified reports mention a violent dispute during
      the event and signs of forced entry into the service corridors.\n\nInvestigators
      recovered several items from John P.\u2019s childhood home two days later,
      including handwritten notes and tampered electronics. A sealed document found
      on-site is currently under forensic examination.\n\nLaw enforcement has declined
      to comment on whether foul play is suspected. No charges have been filed at
      this time. The Velvet Room remains closed until further notice."

      the locked home office room in John\u2019s childhood house, this sealed document
      resists all digital decoding attempts \u2014 as if it was never meant to be
      opened again. Most of its contents are crossed out, hastily scribbled over,
      or rendered completely illegible. However, a few fragments remain intact, hinting
      at a surveillance system discreetly installed throughout the house, with references
      to specific camera feeds and timestamps. Some notes appear dated just days
      before John's disappearance. The overall tone of the annotations suggests rising
      paranoia \u2014 or perhaps preparation. Whether John wrote them all is unclear."
